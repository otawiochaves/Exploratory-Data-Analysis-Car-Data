## Car Dataset Exploration, Visualization and Analysis

Welcome to my portfolio project on Car Dataset Exploration and Visualization! In this project, I have demonstrated various techniques for data exploration, descriptive statistics analysis, and custom visualizations. The goal of this project is to provide insights into the car dataset and uncover meaningful patterns and relationships between variables.


### Dataset

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/goyalshalini93/car-data

The Car Dataset contains information about various attributes of cars, such as make, model, year, engine specifications, transmission type, fuel type, MPG (miles per gallon), vehicle size, market category, popularity, and MSRP (manufacturer's suggested retail price).


### Key Features

1. **Data Cleaning:** The dataset is thoroughly cleaned to ensure data consistency and handle missing values or duplicates. This step lays the foundation for accurate analysis and visualization.


2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Visualizations:** I have performed EDA to understand the distribution, range, and statistical characteristics of the variables. Using popular Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn, I have created a wide range of visualizations, including bar plots, scatter plots, histograms, and custom visualizations. These visualizations help in identifying trends, correlations, and outliers in the dataset.


3. **Descriptive Statistics Analysis:** Descriptive statistics provide valuable insights into the dataset by summarizing its main characteristics. I have conducted a comprehensive analysis of descriptive statistics, including measures of central tendency, dispersion, and shape of distributions.


4. **Exploring Relationships between Variables:** One of the primary objectives of this project is to explore the relationships between different variables in the car dataset. By analyzing the data and visualizations, I have investigated the relationships between engine specifications and MPG, the effect of vehicle size on MPG, and the distribution of car prices.


5. **Custom Visualizations:** In addition to standard visualizations, I have created custom visualizations to address specific questions and provide a deeper understanding of the dataset. These visualizations highlight unique insights and uncover hidden patterns that may not be apparent through traditional approaches.


6. **Insights and Findings:** Based on the analysis, visualizations, and descriptive statistics, I have derived key insights and findings about the car dataset. These insights shed light on the most popular car brands, the impact of engine specifications on MPG, the relationship between vehicle size and MPG, and the distribution of car prices.
